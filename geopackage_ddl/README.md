The `sql` folder contains the informatic code which is behind the INSPIRE Soil Geopackage.  
Using the SQL code in the `create.sql` file, you can recreate the Geopackage containing the full INSPIRE Soil structure.

## Recreating the Geopackage Containing the INSPIRE Soil Structure

To do this:  
1. Open the empty GeoPackage model available at [http://www.geopackage.org/data/empty.gpkg](http://www.geopackage.org/data/empty.gpkg) using a database manager (e.g., DBeaver).  
2. Execute the SQL instructions from the `create.sql` file in the query window.  

- The `create.sql` file includes:  
    - **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Instructions to create tables and their relationships.  
    - **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Instructions to populate the `codelist` table with the necessary codelists required for its functionality.  

- Some constraints have been managed through both form management and trigger creation, in order to:
    - assist user data entry.  
    - ensures data integrity in case of massive data entry.

## Create More Than One Geometric Layer Linked to the SoilBody Table  

It is possible to create more than one geometric layer linked to the SoilBody table, to do this use the code provided in `SoilBody_newgeom.sql`.

Some names in the code need to be changed for it to work correctly, as described below.

1. SoilBody geometry table 

    - CREATE TABLE soilbody_newname  ** CHANGE NAME **

2. gpkg_contents INSERT

    - 'soilbody_newname',   ** CHANGE NAME ** the name should be as entered in point 1
    - 'f_sbsi',  ** CHANGE NAME ID**
    - 'soilbody_newname Table',   ** CHANGE NAME DESCRIPTION  OPTIONAL** the name should be as entered in point 1

3. Spatial index
    - CREATE INDEX soiBody_geom_idxsi ON soilbody_newname(geom);  ** CHANGE NAME INDEX ** AND ** CHANGE NAME AFTER ON ** the name should be as entered in point 1

4. gpkg_geometry_columns INSERT 
    - 'soilbody_newname',  ** CHANGE NAME ** the name should be as entered in point 1

---

## Codelist Table.

Codelists in the SO (Soil) INSPIRE domain are essential for ensuring a standardized representation of soil data across the European Union. They enable consistent classification and encoding of specific values (e.g., soil types, usage categories) across different languages and applications, ensuring interoperability and semantic integrity in environmental datasets.

Although the codelist table has no relationship with other tables, its presence is crucial for the correct data management and control. Although the codelist table has no relationship with other tables, its presence is crucial for the correct data management and control.. It includes replicates of all  SO domain valid codes extracted from the INSPIRE registry (https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/registry). Essentially, if a coded value is in the table, it is supposed to be valid; if not, the code is to be considered as incorrect, and the relative value isn’t stored.
 
The presence of the codelist table in the Geopackage allows forms for displaying dropdown lists, simplifying the data entry. However, up to now (01/2025), not all the mandatory items foreseen in the INSPIRE SOIL UML structure have been populated into the INSPIRE registry. For those mandatory items foreseen in the INSPIRE SOIL UML structure for which there is not yet a published codelis inside the INSPIRE registry, that is, for WRBdiagnostichorizon, ProcessParameterNameValue, WRBReferenceSoilGroupValue (2014), WRBReferenceSoilGroupValue (2022), WRBQualifierValue (2022), and WRBSpecifierValue (2022)), we made reference to other officially mainatined controlled vocabularies by means of URI.
 
Moreover, internal codelists have also been added to the overmentioned table to manage forms more efficiently.
