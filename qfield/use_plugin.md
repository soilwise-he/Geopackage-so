# QField – Operational Guide (QGIS ⇆ QField)
This short guide briefly describes:
- how to **install the QField plugin (QFieldSync) from QGIS**;
- how to **identify the projects** inside the provided **GeoPackage**;
- how to **export/package the QGIS project** for use with QField (Android, iOS, Windows);
- how to **transfer the data to the device** for use with QField (Android, iOS, Windows).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an introductory guide; for more details on using QField and its plugin, please refer to the  official [QFieldSync for Cable Packaging](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfs/) documentation.


## Install the QField plugin from QGIS

### Step‑by‑step procedure

    <img src="../assets/qfield_04.webp"
         alt="Fig.1" align="left" width="500">
  </a>
<strong>Open QGIS</strong> (Desktop).<br>
<br>   
① Go to <strong>Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins…</strong> <br>
<br>
In the search field, type <strong>“QFieldSync”</strong> ② (in some installations it is shown as <strong>“QField”</strong>).<br>
<br>   
Select <strong>QFieldSync</strong> ③ and click <strong>Install Plugin</strong>.④ <br>
<br>   
(Optional) Verify it is enabled: <strong>Installed</strong> tab → check <strong>QFieldSync</strong>.
</p>
<br clear="all"><br> 


### What the plugin enables
- **Layer configuration** for offline use (copy to GeoPackage, attachment handling).
- **Export/Packaging** of the project for QField.
- Conversion to **relative paths**, copying of resources (icons, media), inclusion of styles and forms.

> [!TIP]
> Before exporting, always save the QGIS project and ensure **paths are relative** (**Project → Properties → Paths**) to avoid broken links on the device.

## Identifying the project in the GeoPackage
The provided GeoPackage contains **two different QGIS projects** that point to the **same data source** (the same layers/tables in the same `.gpkg`):

<p>
  <a href="../assets/qfield_05.webp" target="_blank">

  </a>
① <strong>Project `_PRJ_SO` for QGIS – Optimized for desktop</strong> use (full symbology, views, and tools for office work).<br>
<br>
②  <strong>Project `_PRJ_SO_QField` for QField – Optimized for mobile devices</strong> with <strong>custom forms</strong>, pre‑filled fields, simplified widgets, and constraints for field data capture.<br>
</p>
<br clear="all"><br> 

- **Project `_PRJ_SO` for QGIS** – Optimized for **desktop** use (full symbology, views, and tools for office work).
- **Project `_PRJ_SO_QField` for QField** – Optimized for **mobile devices** with **custom forms**, pre‑filled fields, simplified widgets, and constraints for field data capture.

Both projects use **the same GeoPackage** as their data source; this ensures consistency and alignment between office work and field work.

> [!NOTE]
> - Open `_PRJ_SO` in **QGIS** when working on desktop.
> - Open `_PRJ_SO_QField` in **QField** (or use it as the source for export via QFieldSync).

## Exporting/Packaging the QGIS project for QField

<p>
  <a href="../assets/qfield_06.webp" target="_blank">
    <img src="../assets/qfield_06.webp"
         alt="Fig.1" align="left" width="500">
  </a>
From the <strong>QFieldSync</strong> menu or toolbar, choose <strong>Export/Package for QField</strong>. ①<br>
<br>   
Select the <strong>destination folder</strong>. ② <br>
<br>   
③ Configure layers for offline use <strong>Project Configuration</strong> <br>
<br>   
④ Start the export: the plugin will copy data, styles, and resources, converting paths to <strong>relative</strong> ones.
</p>
<br clear="all"><br> 


>[!TIP]
> For **each layer**, you can set the mode in **Project Configuration**:
> - **Copy to GeoPackage** *(recommended)*: creates an offline copy for field editing.
> - **Keep original path**: keeps the reference to the external file (less portable).
> - **Read‑only**: if it must not be edited.


>[!NOTE]
> Unless there are specific needs, it is discouraged to change the project configuration. The full export of the GeoPackage can be performed without altering the configuration.


### Typical resulting structure:

<p>
  <a href="../assets/qfield_07.webp" target="_blank">
    <img src="../assets/qfield_07.webp"
         alt="Fig.1" align="left" width="500">
  </a>
/Project_QField/<br>
├─ <strong>project.qgs </strong> ① QGIS/QField project file.<br>
├─ <strong>image.png   </strong> ② Image used by the project (see notes below).<br>
├─ <strong>package.zip </strong> ③ Archive for distribution/transfer/Project_QField/<br>
└─ <strong>database.gpkg </strong> ④ Data store (GeoPackage).
</p> 
  
<br clear="all"><br> 


### What each file is for
- **`.qgs`** → The *project file* (map, layers, styles, forms). This is the file you open in **QGIS** and **QField**.

- **Best practice:** In QGIS, set **Project → Properties → Paths → ‘Store relative paths’** to avoid broken links on the device.

- **`.gpkg`** → The *GeoPackage* that contains your layers/tables and, if configured, attachments. QField reads and (optionally) edits this file offline.

- **`.png`** → An image referenced by the project. It may be used as one of the following:
  - **Project icon** (*Project Properties → General → Project icon*),
  - **Form image** (a widget in a custom form),
  - **Raster symbol/marker** in a layer style,
  - **Thumbnail** generated during export.

## Transfer to device
- **Android/iOS:** copy the folder/zip via **USB** or **cloud** (OneDrive/Drive/Nextcloud). On iOS, use the **Files** app or share directly with QField.
- **Windows:** copy the folder/zip and open the project with **QField for Windows**.

>[!WARNING]
>  **Write errors:** make sure layers are not read‑only and that the device allows writing to the project folder.  
> **Heavy rasters:** consider **resampling** or using lighter tiles for better performance on mobile.


## Synchronization of the QField‑edited project in the SoilWise Geopackage

From the <strong>QFieldSync</strong> menu or toolbar, choose <strong>Sinchronize from QField</strong>. ①<br>
<br>   
Select the <strong>folder containing </strong> ②  the QField project that you have copied back to your computer after the editing session, or directly access the project folder on the device if it is still connected. <br>
<br>   
③ <strong>Sinchronize</strong> <br>
