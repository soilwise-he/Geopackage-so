# Open the Soilwise Geopackage in QGIS

## Introduction

The **SoilWise GeoPackage** contains an **embedded QGIS project** named **`PRJ_SO`** that exposes **preconfigured custom forms** to guide users in **data entry** and **visualization** 

This capability is available **even in the “empty” GeoPackage**, providing a consistent, ready‑to‑use working environment from the very beginning.

From a technical standpoint, the QGIS project is **stored directly inside the GeoPackage** in the **`qgis_projects`** table; each project is saved as **textual content** representing a **QGZ archive** (a zipped package) which, in turn, contains the **`.qgs` project file in XML format** [^1][^2]. This ensures that the project and the data live in the **same `.gpkg` file**, preserving styles, layouts, views, and settings as defined by SoilWise.

Opening is **one‑click**: select the **embedded project** from the GeoPackage and the SoilWise environment loads exactly as designed, with **forms, styles, and settings** ready to use.

## Open the PRJ_SO Project

Open Qgis.

<p>
  <img src="../assets/01_Qgis.webp"
       alt="Fig.1" align="left" width="500">
In the Browser Tab, right-click on the
Geopackage icon ① and click on “New
Connection”. ②
</p>

<br clear="all"><br>

<p>
  <img src="../assets/02_Qgis.webp"
       alt="Fig.2" align="left" width="500">
Search the file system for the Geopackage
file you want to use.

Inside the newly connected file, ③ you will
find the `PRJ_SO` project. ④

Double-click on it, and the project will open.

> [!CAUTION]
> Given the system’s complexity, it is **strongly recommended to always use the complete project** to maintain data integrity.
> 
> Loading only a subset of layers may prevent records from being saved: QGIS cannot display or manage related objects if their corresponding layers are not loaded, and due to **relationships and internal database triggers**, this can lead to errors or failed save operations. 

> [!WARNING]
>If the GeoPackage **file has been renamed**, the project will not load correctly.  
>To resolve this issue, please refer to the solutions described in the documentation [How to Handle Issues Caused by Renaming the Soilwise GeoPackage](./rename_geopackage.md)
